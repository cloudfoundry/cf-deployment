# cf-deployment Legacy Ops-files

The ops files in this directory
are meant to enable operators of `cf-deployment`
who have migrated from `cf-release`.

Operators who never migrated from `cf-release`
to `cf-deployment`
need not concern themselves with this directory.

This is the README for Legacy Ops-files. To learn more about `cf-deployment`, go to the main [README](../README.md). 

- For general Ops-files, check out the [Ops-file README](../README.md).
- For experimental Ops-files, check out the [Experimental Ops-file README](../experimental/README.md).
- For Community Ops-files, check out the [Community Ops-file README](../community/README.md).
- For Addons Ops-files that can be applied to manifests or runtime configs, check out the [Addons Ops-file README](addons/README.md).
- For Backup and Restore Ops-files (for configuring your deployment for use with [BBR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore)), checkout the [Backup and Restore Ops-files README](../backup-and-restore/README.md).

| Name | Purpose | Notes |
|:---  |:---     |:---   |
| [`keep-haproxy-ssl-pem.yml`](keep-haproxy-ssl-pem.yml) | Maintains operator-provided pem for haproxy terminating ssl connections | Requires `use-haproxy.yml`. Provides ability to set value for `haproxy_ssl_pem` |
| [`keep-original-blobstore-directory-keys.yml`](keep-original-blobstore-directory-keys.yml) | Maintains operator-provided blobstore directory keys | Provides ability to set values for `app_package_directory_key`, `buildpack_directory_key`, `droplet_directory_key`, and `resource_directory_key` |
| [`keep-original-internal-usernames.yml`](keep-original-internal-usernames.yml) | Maintains operator-provided usernames | Provides ability to set values for `properties.nats.user`, `properties.cc.staging_upload_user`, `properties.router.status.user` |
| [`keep-original-postgres-configuration.yml`](keep-original-postgres-configuration.yml) | Maintains operator-provided database names and usernames. Requires `use-postgres.yml` | Provides ability to set values for cc, uaa, bbs, and locket databases |
| [`keep-original-routing-postgres-configuration.yml`](keep-original-routing-postgres-configuration.yml) | Maintains operator-provided database name and username. Requires `use-postgres.yml` | Provides ability to set values for routing-api database |
| [`keep-static-ips.yml`](keep-static-ips.yml) | Holds `consul` and `nats` instances at a static IP address for transition between `cf-release` and `cf-deployment`. | Deployers must provide the IP addresses |
| [`old-droplet-mitigation.yml`](old-droplet-mitigation.yml) | Mitigates against old droplets that may still have a legacy security vulnerability. | See comment in the ops file for more details. |
