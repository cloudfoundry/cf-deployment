# cf-deployment Experimental Ops-files

This is the README for Experimental Ops-files. To learn more about `cf-deployment`, go to the main [README](../../README.md).

- For General Ops-files, check out the [Ops-file README](../README.md).
- For Addons Ops-files that can be applied to manifests or runtime configs, check out the [Addons Ops-file README](../addons/README.md).
- For Backup and Restore Ops-files (for configuring your deployment for use with [BBR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore)), checkout the [Backup and Restore Ops-files README](../backup-and-restore/README.md).
- For Community Ops-files, check out the [Community Ops-file README](../community/README.md).

"Experimental" Ops-file represent configurations that we expect to promote to blessed configuration eventually, meaning that, once the configurations have been sufficiently validated, they will either become default (inlined into the base manifest), or GA'd as an optional feature (promoted from experimental to operations directory). Please follow the [ops file workflows](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/main/ops-file-promotion-workflow.md)
