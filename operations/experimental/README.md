"Experimental" ops-files represent configurations
that we expect to promote to blessed configuration eventually,
meaning that,
once the configurations have been sufficiently validated,
they will become part of cf-deployment.yml
and the ops-files will be removed.

| [`windows-component-syslog-ca.yml`](windows-component-syslog-ca.yml) | Forces windows component syslog to respect only the provided CA for cert validation. | Requires `windows-enable-component-syslog.yml`. Can also be applied to runtime config, in the manner of the `component-syslog-custom-ca.yml` addon. The operations in this file are intended to be merged into that one when they graduate from experimental status. This ops file gets all its variables from the same place as that one, though not all are used. |
| [`windows-enable-component-syslog.yml`](windows-enable-component-syslog.yml) | Collocates a job from windows-syslog-release on all windows-based instances to forward job logs in syslog format. | Compatible with both `windows2016` and `windows2012R2` instances, even at the same time.
