# cf-deployment Experimental Ops-files

This is the README for Experimental Ops-files. To learn more about `cf-deployment`, go to the main [README](../README.md). 

- For general Ops-files, check out the [Ops-file README](../README.md).
- For Legacy Ops-files, check out the [Legacy Ops-file README](../legacy/README.md).
- For Community Ops-files, checkout the [Community Ops-file README](../community/README.md).
- For Addons Ops-files that can be applied to manifests or runtime configs, check out the [Addons Ops-file README](../addons/README.md).
- For Backup and Restore Ops-files (for configuring your deployment for use with [BBR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore)), checkout the [Backup and Restore Ops-files README](../backup-and-restore/README.md).

"Experimental" ops-files represent configurations
that we expect to promote to blessed configuration eventually,
meaning that,
once the configurations have been sufficiently validated,
they will become part of cf-deployment.yml
and the ops-files will be removed.
