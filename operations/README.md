## IaaS-required Ops-files

| Name | Purpose | Notes |
|:---  |:---     |:---   |
| **AWS** | | |
| [`aws.yml`](aws.yml) | Overrides the loggregator endpoint port to 4443. | It is required to have a separate port from the standard HTTPS port (443) for loggregator traffic in order to use the AWS load balancer. |
| [`use-s3-blobstore.yml`](use-s3-blobstore.yml) | Replaces local WebDAV blobstore with external s3 blobstore. | Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-s3-blobstore.yml) for s3 credentials and bucket names. |
| **Azure** | | |
| [`azure.yml`](azure.yml) | Sets gorouter's `frontend_idle_timeout` to value appropriate for Azure load balancers. | Any value below 240 should work. |
| [`use-azure-storage-blobstore.yml`](use-azure-storage-blobstore.yml) | Replaces local WebDAV blobstore with external Azure Storage blobstore. | Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-azure-storage-blobstore.yml) for Azure credentials and container names. |
| **GCP** | | |
| [`use-gcs-blobstore.yml`](use-gcs-blobstore.yml) | Replaces local WebDAV blobstore with external Google blobstore. | Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-gcs-blobstore.yml) for gcp credentials and bucket names. |
| [`use-gcs-blobstore-service-account.yml`](use-gcs-blobstore-service-account.yml) | Enables service account credentials for Google blobstore. | Requires `use-gcs-blobstore.yml`. Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-gcs-blobstore-service-account.yml) for gcp service account credentials. |
| **Openstack** | | |
| [`openstack.yml`](openstack.yml) | Used for deploying Cloud Foundry on OpenStack with BOSH | See [OpenStack](../iaas-support/openstack/README.md) documentation. |
| [`use-swift-blobstore.yml`](use-swift-blobstore.yml) | Replaces local WebDAV blobstore with OpenStack swift blobstore. Used for deploying Cloud Foundry on OpenStack with BOSH | Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-swift-blobstore.yml) for OpenStack credentials and directory names. If you plan using the [Swift ops file](use-swift-blobstore.yml) to enable Swift as blobstore for the Cloud Controller, you should also run the [Swift extension](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-openstack-validator/tree/master/extensions/object_storage). |


## Feature-based Ops-files

| Name | Purpose | Notes |
|:---  |:---     |:---   |
| [`bosh-lite.yml`](bosh-lite.yml) | Enables `cf-deployment` to be deployed on `bosh-lite`. | See [bosh-lite](../iaas-support/bosh-lite/README.md) documentation. |
| [`cf-syslog-skip-cert-verify.yml`](cf-syslog-skip-cert-verify.yml) | This disables TLS verification when connecting to a HTTPS syslog drain. | |
| [`configure-confab-timeout.yml`](configure-confab-timeout.yml) | Allows deployer to configure `consul_agent` Confab startup timeout on `consul` instances. | Adds new variable `confab_timeout` in seconds, must be at least 60. |
| [`configure-default-router-group.yml`](configure-default-router-group.yml) | Allows deployer to configure reservable ports for default tcp router group by passing variable `default_router_group_reservable_ports`. |  |
| [`disable-router-tls-termination.yml`](disable-router-tls-termination.yml) | Eliminates keys related to performing TLS termination within the gorouter job. | Useful for deployments where TLS termination is performed prior to the gorouter - for instance, on AWS, such termination is commonly done at the ELB. This also eliminates the need to specify `((router_ssl.certificate))` and `((router_ssl.private_key))` in the var files. |
| [`enable-backup-restore-s3-unversioned.yml`](enable-backup-restore-s3-unversioned.yml) | Enables the backup and restore of unversioned S3 blobstores. | Requires `enable-backup-restore.yml` and `use-s3-blobstore.yml` |
| [`enable-cc-rate-limiting.yml`](enable-cc-rate-limiting.yml) | Enable rate limiting for UAA-authenticated endpoints. | Introduces variables `cc_rate_limiter_general_limit` and `cc_rate_limiter_unauthenticated_limit` |
| [`enable-nfs-ldap.yml`](enable-nfs-ldap.yml) | Enables LDAP authentication for NFS volume services | Requires `enable-nfs-volume-service.yml`. Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-enable-nfs-ldap.yml) |
| [`enable-nfs-volume-service.yml`](enable-nfs-volume-service.yml) | Enables volume support and deploys an NFS broker and volume driver | |
| [`enable-privileged-container-support.yml`](enable-privileged-container-support.yml) | Enables Diego privileged container support. | |
| [`enable-uniq-consul-node-name.yml`](enable-uniq-consul-node-name.yml) | Configure Diego cell `consul_agent` jobs to have a unique id per instance. |  |
| [`override-app-domains.yml`](override-app-domains.yml) | Switches from using the system domain as a shared app domain; allows the configuration of one or more shared app domains instead. | Adds [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-override-app-domains.yml).<br/> **CAUTION:** Seeding domains with a router group name (including TCP domains) may cause problems deploying. Please use the `cf` CLI to add shared domains with router group names. |
| [`rename-deployment.yml`](rename-deployment.yml) | Allows a deployer to rename the deployment by passing a variable `deployment_name` |  |
| [`rename-network.yml`](rename-network.yml) | Allows a deployer to rename the network by passing a variable `network_name` |  |
| [`scale-database-cluster.yml`](scale-database-cluster.yml) | Scales cf-deployment database to 3 nodes across 3 zones (z1, z2, z3). | Cannot be used with postgres as it will not scale. |
| [`scale-to-one-az.yml`](scale-to-one-az.yml) | Scales cf-deployment down to a single instance per instance group, placing them all into a single AZ. | Effectively halves the deployment's footprint. Should be applied before other ops files. |
| [`secure-rep-admin-api.yml`](secure-rep-admin-api.yml) | Secure that the cell's admin API endpoints using TLS | |
| [`secure-rep-admin-api-windows.yml`](secure-rep-admin-api-windows.yml) | Secure the Windows cells' admin API endpoints using TLS. | Requires `windows-cell.yml` |
| [`set-bbs-active-key.yml`](set-bbs-active-key.yml) | Allows a deployer to set the `bbs` active key label by passing a variable `diego_bbs_active_key_label` |  |
| [`set-router-static-ips.yml`](set-router-static-ips.yml) | Allows a deployer to set the static IPs for the `router` VMs by passing a variable `router_static_ips` | `router_static_ips` variable must be provided as a compacted YAML array, e.g. `-v router_static_ips=[10.0.16.4,10.0.47.5]` |
| [`stop-skipping-tls-validation.yml`](stop-skipping-tls-validation.yml) | Enforces `TLS` validation for all components which skip it in the base `cf-deployment.yml` manifest. | See the base [README](../README.md#tls) for details. |
| [`use-blobstore-cdn.yml`](use-blobstore-cdn.yml) | Adds support for accessing the `droplets` and `resource_pool` blobstore buckets via signed urls over a cdn. | This assumes that you are using the same keypair for both buckets. Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-blobstore-cdn.yml) |
| [`use-compiled-releases.yml`](use-compiled-releases.yml) | Instead of having your BOSH Director compile each release, use this ops-file to use pre-compiled releases for a deployment speed improvement. | These releases are compiled against a specific stemcell version that is listed in the opsfile.  Note that no Windows releases are currently compiled. |
| [`use-external-dbs.yml`](use-external-dbs.yml) | Removes the MySQL instance group, cf-mysql release, and all cf-mysql variables. **Warning**: this does not migrate data, and will delete existing database instance groups. | This requires an external data store.   Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-external-dbs.yml) for DB connection details which will need to be provided at deploy time. This must be applied _before_ any ops files that removes jobs that use a database, such as the ops file to remove the routing API. |
| [`use-haproxy.yml`](use-haproxy.yml) | Deploys a single haproxy instance to be used as a load balancer. | This opsfile doesn't depend on use of an IaaS VIP and doesn't use `keepalived` property of the [haproxy-boshrelease](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease). |
| [`use-haproxy-public-network.yml`](use-haproxy-public-network.yml) | Puts haproxy instance on a public network with a static IP assigned to it. | Requires `use-haproxy.yml`. This ops file also requires your BOSH cloud-config to have a `vm_extension` called `cf-haproxy-network-properties`, which configures firewall rules to allow public traffic on the necessary ports (You will need to allow at least the default HTTP and HTTPS ports (`80` and `443`), port `4443` for `doppler`, as well as the [port range configured for the TCP Routing](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/blob/a6983a1b3345cd9f5af0f26d5c10265de0c7851f/cf-deployment.yml#L726)). |
| [`use-latest-stemcell.yml`](use-latest-stemcell.yml) | Use the latest stemcell available on your BOSH director instead of the one in `cf-deployment.yml`. **Caution**: This ops-file should not be used in conjunction with `use-compiled-releases.yml`, since the latter relies on a specific stemcell version being used. |  |
| [`use-latest-windows-stemcell.yml`](use-latest-windows-stemcell.yml) | Use the latest `windows2012R2` stemcell available on your BOSH director instead of the one in `windows-cell.yml` | Requires `windows-cell.yml` |
| [`use-postgres.yml`](use-postgres.yml) | Replaces the MySQL instance group with a postgres instance group. **Warning**: this will lead to total data loss if applied to an existing deployment with MySQL or removed from an existing deployment with postgres. |  |
| [`use-trusted-ca-cert-for-apps.yml`](use-trusted-ca-cert-for-apps.yml) | Injects the CA specified with `trusted_cert_for_apps` into the Diego trusted store | This store determines which CAs will be trusted in the app environment. |
| [`windows-cell.yml`](windows-cell.yml) | Deploys a Windows 2012R2 Diego cell and adds releases necessary for Windows. | **Known issue**: Windows cells deployed to AWS will likely have their disks fill up after ~9 days (depending on load). The bosh-windows team is actively working on a fix for this. Operators who want to deploy windows cells to AWS anyway may want to recreate those cells periodically.  |
| [`use-latest-windows2016-stemcell.yml`](use-latest-windows2016-stemcell.yml) | Use the latest `windows2016` stemcell available on your BOSH director instead of the one in `windows2016-cell.yml` | Requires `windows2016-cell.yml` |
| [`use-offline-windows2016fs.yml`](use-offline-windows2016fs.yml) | Use the offline version of [windows2016fs-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/windows2016fs-release) | Requires `windows2016-cell.yml`. Suitable for environments without internet access. Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/windows2016fs-release/blob/master/README.md) to upload the release prior to deploying. |
| [`windows2016-cell.yml`](windows2016-cell.yml) | Deploys a windows 2016 diego cell, adds releases necessary for windows. | Windows2016 stemcell is currently only supported on GCP and Azure. AWS support is currently under development. |
