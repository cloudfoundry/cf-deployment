| [`use-internal-lookup-for-route-services.yml`](use-internal-lookup-for-route-services.yml) | Configure the gorouter to prefer internal lookup of route services. **Warning**: This enables a potential exploit detailed under [CVE-2019-3789](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2019-3789/) |  | **NO** |
| [`use-latest-stemcell.yml`](use-latest-stemcell.yml) | Use the latest stemcell available on your BOSH director instead of the one in `cf-deployment.yml`. **Caution**: This ops-file should not be used in conjunction with `use-compiled-releases.yml`, since the latter relies on a specific stemcell version being used. |  | **NO** |
| [`use-latest-windows2019-stemcell.yml`](use-latest-windows2019-stemcell.yml) | Use the latest `windows2019` stemcell available on your BOSH director instead of the one in `windows2019-cell.yml` | Requires `windows2019-cell.yml` | **NO** |
