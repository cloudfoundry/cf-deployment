## IaaS-required Ops-files

| Name | Purpose | Notes | Currently validated in Release Integration CI pipelines? |
|:---  |:---     |:---   |:---   |
| **GCP** | | | |
| [`use-gcs-blobstore-service-account.yml`](use-gcs-blobstore-service-account.yml) | Enables service account credentials for Google blobstore. | Requires `use-external-blobstore.yml`. Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-gcs-blobstore-service-account.yml) for gcp service account email/json-key and bucket names. | **YES** |
| [`use-gcs-blobstore-access-key.yml`](use-gcs-blobstore-access-key.yml) | Enables access key credentials for Google blobstore. | Requires `use-external-blobstore.yml`.

| [`aws.yml`](aws.yml) | Overrides the loggregator endpoint port to 4443. | It is required to have a separate port from the standard HTTPS port (443) for loggregator traffic in order to use "classic" AWS ELBs. Newer "Application Load Balancers" and "Network Load Balancers" (as setup by [bbl](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader) >= v7.0.0) should not require this port override, so no need to use this ops-file if you're using the newer load balancer. | **YES** |
| [`use-s3-blobstore.yml`](use-s3-blobstore.yml) | Configures external blobstore to use Amazon S3. | Requires `use-external-blobstore.yml`. Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-s3-blobstore.yml) for s3 credentials and bucket names. | **YES** |

Introduces [new variables](example-vars-files/vars-use-blobstore-cdn.yml) | **NO** |
| [`use-compiled-releases.yml`](use-compiled-releases.yml) | Instead of having your BOSH Director compile each release, use this ops-file to use pre-compiled releases for a deployment speed improvement. | These releases are compiled against a specific stemcell version that is listed in the opsfile.
