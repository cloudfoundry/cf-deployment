# Promoting/Deprecating ops files

Quick note on "Experimental" Ops-file: Expirmental Ops-file represent configurations that we expect to promote to blessed configuration eventually, meaning that, once the configurations have been sufficiently validated, they will either become default (inlined into the base manifest), or GA'd as an optional feature (promoted from experimental to operations directory). The following workflow illustrates the sequence of events to promote an experimental Ops-file.

*_PR process is excluded for brevity._*

> How to correctly generate symlink.
Move the experimental ops file to the operations folder and create a symlink in the experimental folder pointing to the moved ops file. The symlink should be named the same as the original ops file.
Navigate to the experimental folder and run the following command:
```
ln -s ../use-noble-stemcell.yml use-noble-stemcell.yml
```

> It is critical that you do not remove the experimental ops file during your promotion.

Operators might be still using the experimental ops file as part of their deployment and removing the file will break their automated environments. Once the deprecation notice is posted, the support for experimental ops file will be marked for removal on the next major cf-deployment release.

## Deprecating an experimental ops file

_Please do not remove the file._
